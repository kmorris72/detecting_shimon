# detecting_shimon: Created in Fall 2018 as a project for Georgia Tech's Robotic Musicianship VIP Group

## Explanation
The goal of this project was to create a pipeline of sorts through which VIP students can easily add new object classes to the YOLO object detection model. YOLO can be trained using the neural network framework [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet), so this respository is meant to provide a streamlined way of getting data ready for training with darknet.
